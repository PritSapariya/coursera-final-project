# coursera-final-project
coursera-final project-python data collection and REST APIs-python3 programming specialization


<------------------------- IMPORTANT ---------------------------->

This code will only run on coursra platform or Runstone Environment. 
I have uploaded this type of code beacuse many time students faces problem in this project with Runstone Environment because they provide some extra module like "requests_with_caching" instead of "requests".
